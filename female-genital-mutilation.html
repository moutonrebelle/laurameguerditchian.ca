  title="Sketches"
  description="The sketching phase allowed to establish a clear wireframe and overall feel of what web page would look like as well as how the poster would create traffic on the landing page. While the initial idea was to create a custom QR code, it was then decided to take another direction that would be probably more efficient and engaging with users."

  title="Outcome"
  description="An interactive poster using augmented reality to enable the audience to access a landing page about FGM as part of the campaign #endfgm. This FGM poster is an interactive tool for raising awareness that can later be developped into a whole campaign. To accomplish this, the poster would use an AR reader through its symbol that would lead to a landing page specially designed for this campaign when taken on picture via a mobile phone."
