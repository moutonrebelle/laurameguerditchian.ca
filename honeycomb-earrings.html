  title="Goal"
  description="The goal was to create a unique piece of jewelry that was inspired by bees. This could be worn as a statement and be part of a campaign to save the population of bees as they are currently endangered. The design was meant to be both organic and geometric to create an original design. This prototype could be reproduced with scrap pieces of wood and plastic."
