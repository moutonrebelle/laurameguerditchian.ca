  description="The process of creation started with a few sketches of elements that could be include in the Snapchat filter. After selecting the elements that would be include, the sketches were vectorized with Illustrator. Once this was done, the elements were brought into Lens Studio where the filter was created, then published. An icon that people could scan in order to use the filter was also made."
